# Train-Scheduler
Unit 7 homework for UCSD extension coding Bootcamp

In this activity I will be creating a web application which can take inputs from users in the form of text and store them in a remote database (firebase). The application will then populate some tabular data on the screen of the users browser on any machine and display any information that has been inputted in the correct format. In this case, that information is trains and their schedule. The table will present the user with a time of next arrival for the train as well as the number of minutes till that time. Initial inputs require a name for the train, a destination, the starting time inputted in military time format and also the frequency with which the route will run a train car.

This application is meant to serve as practice for me as a student at the UCSD extension coding bootcamp in making use of remote server features to populate persistent data on a webpage. This involves the use of skills we have learned in html, javascript, and css with a little help from libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Bootstrap and of course firebase as our remote realtime data server.

It can serve as an accurate means to check arrival times for trains or even buses assuming they follow a fixed schedule of intervals as specified by the user at the time of input. It was written from a blank page by myself, and is maintained exclusively by me as well. I made use of references from both the in class coursework from the UCSD Extension coding bootcamp and the momentJS official documentation. 

Enjoy! :)
